			"intro-names": "Takuzu is known by many names, such as Binary Puzzle, Binairo, Binero, Tohu-wa-vohu, and many more.",
			"intro-description": "It is a logical thinking game that combines simple rules with surprising depth. Initially, the game seems simple as it involves filling a grid with just two colors. However, as you progress to higher levels, Takuzu reveals a complex layer of strategy that makes the puzzles significantly more challenging.",
			"goal-heading": "The Goal",
			"goal-text": "The goal of a binary puzzle is simple: fill every cell of the grid with a {symbolZero} or a {symbolOne} according to three simple rules.",
			"rules-heading": "The Rules at a Glance",
			"rules-link": "Click here for a detailed description of the rules with examples",
			"rules-list-1": "Each row and column must contain an equal number of {symbolZeroPlural} and {symbolOnePlural}.",

				"description-2": "For example, in a 4x4 grid, each row and column should contain two {symbolOnePlural} and two {symbolZeroPlural}.",
				"example-correct": "There are exactly 3 {symbolZeroPlural} and 3 {symbolOnePlural} in the line of 6 cells.",
				"example-incorrect": "There are 4 {symbolZeroPlural}, but the row has 6 cells, which means only three {symbolZeroPlural} are allowed.",

			"max-two-consecutive": {
				"description-1": "No more than two of the same TODO:symbol/number/color can be next to or under each other.",
				"description-2": "This means you cannot have three consecutive {symbolOnePlural} or {symbolZeroPlural} in any row or column.",

			"identify-pairs": {
				"description": "If two identical {symbolOrColorPlural} are next to each other, we call this a 'pair'. Since each {symbolOrColor} may appear a maximum of two times next to or below each other, the adjacent cells can be filled in with the opposite {symbolOrColor}.",

				"name": "Complete rows and columns",
				"description": "Each row and column must contain an equal number of each {symbolOrColor}. If a row or column already has the maximum number of one {symbolOrColor}, then the remaining empty cells must become the other {symbolOrColor}.",
				"example": "This row has 6 cells, which means there are 3 of each {symbolOrColor} required. As you can see in the top row, there are 3 {symbolOnePlural}, which means all other cells should be {symbolZeroPlural}."

			"prevent-duplicate-lines": {
				"name": "Prevent duplicate rows and columns",
				"description": "Each row and column must be unique. \nFor example, you can use this technique if you already have a completely filled in row or column, and there is another row or column that is almost the same. \nMissing cells can sometimes only be filled in one way without the two rows or columns becoming the same.",
